# Face_Mask_detection
My second task as Machine learning intern at sync's interns 
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of a face mask detection system using machine learning techniques.

The project aims to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not, facilitating the enforcement of safety protocols and reducing the spread of infectious diseases

The face mask detection system is based on deep learning algorithms that are trained on a dataset of labeled images with and without masks. The model can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask in real-time video feeds or images.

### The system is built using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. The trained model is deployed using Flask, which provides a simple web interface for users to upload images or videos and receive the mask detection results.

### Dataset

The dataset used for training the face mask detection model was collected from publicly available sources and augmented to include various scenarios and lighting conditions. The dataset contains thousands of images of people with and without masks and is balanced to ensure unbiased model training.

### Results

The trained model achieves high accuracy in detecting whether an individual is wearing a mask or not. The system can be easily integrated into existing security systems or public spaces to ensure that individuals are complying with mask mandates.
